# What is Internet of Things?
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data.

A “Thing” in the context of the Internet of things (IoT), is an entity or physical object that has a Unique identifier, an embedded system and the ability to transfer data over a network.

* Heart monitoring implants
* Biochip transponders on farm animals
* Automobiles with built-in sensors
* DNA analysis devices & Other Wearbles etc.

These devices collect useful data with the help of various existing technologies and then autonomously flow the data between other devices.

# How IoT Works?
The Internet of Things (IoT), also sometimes referred to as the Internet of Everything (IoE), consists of all the web-enabled devices that collect, send and act on data they acquire from their surrounding environments using embedded sensors, processors and communication hardware. These devices, often called "connected" or "smart" devices, can sometimes talk to other related devices, a process called machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, and act on the information they get from one another. Humans can interact with the gadgets to set them up, give them instructions or access the data, but the devices do most of the work on their own without human intervention. Their existence has been made possible by all the tiny mobile components that are available these days, as well as the always- online nature of our home and business networks.

* RFID: To identify and track the data of things.
* Sensor: To collect and process the data to detect the changes in the physical status of things.
* Smart Tech: To enhance the power of the network by developing processing capabilities to different part of the network.
* Nano Tech: To make the smaller and smaller things have the ability to connect and interact.

## The IoT LifeCycle
### Collect
Devices and Sensors are collecting dataeverywhere.
* At a home
* In a car
* At the office
* In the manufacturing plant

### Communicate
Sending data and events through networks to some destiation.
* A cloud platform
* Private data center
* Home network

### Analyze
Creating information from the data.
* Visualizing the data
* Building reports
* Filtering data (paring it down)

### Act
Taking action based on the information and data.
* Communicate with another machine (m2m)
* Send a notification (sms, email, text)
* Talk to another system

## The Structure of IoT
The IoT can be viewed as a gigantic network consisting of networks of devices and computers connected through a series of intermediate technologies where numerous technologies like RFIDs, wireless connections may act as enablers of this connectivity.

* Tagging Things: Real-time item traceability and addressability by RFIDs.
* Feeling Things: Sensors act as primary devices to collect data from the environment.
* Shrinking Things: Miniaturization and Nanotechnology has provoked the ability of smaller things to interact and connect within the “things” or “smart devices.” 
* Thinking Things: Embedded intelligence in devices through sensors has formed the network connection to the Internet. It can make the “things” realizing the intelligent control.
